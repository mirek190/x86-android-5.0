\mainpage libcamera2 Design Documentation

\section overview Overview

libcamera2 is the library that implements the Camera HAL components as
described by Android.

\section gettingstarted Where to start, important classes

\li android::ControlThread implements the HAL main loop.
\li AtomHAL.cpp is the interface implmenting the Android HAL C API defined in camera.h
\li android::AtomISP implements the kernel interface.
\li Worker threads: 1) android::PictureThread, 2) android::PreviewThread, 3) android::CallbacksThread

\section principles Main design principles

The growing pains of the first iteration have help define clear design
goals for this second iteration

\subsection princip1 1. Sequential processing of client requests

As opposed to current design all, now all requests from HAL client
(the camera service) are processed in sequence. Only the main
ControlThread decides what can be run in parallel in other Threads

\subsection princip2 2. Clear Encapsulation

Adopt traditional OOP design of clearly encapsulating the operations
required in the HAL. Each task is clearly encapsulated inside a Thread
object. The roles for each thread are clearly defined and contain no
state. Only the Control Thread is aware of the HAL global state.

\subsection princip3 3. Simple Multi-threading

HAL operations need to be run in parallel. The need for
multi-threading is clear. The new design tries to provide a clean
interface between threads. The key construct is a Message Queue. All
threads have one. Communication between Threads is done on a message
basis. Message can be send synchronously or asynchronously. The Queue
will ensure that they are processed sequentially, but it is flexible
enough to allow the sending entity to be blocked or not until the
processing completes. This reduces drastically the number of locks.

Messages in the queue can also be flushed.

Each threads is a loop processing its own message queue.

\subsection princip4 4. Platform Scalability

The new design tries to tackle the challenging task of supporting
multiple HW platform and products while keeping the HAL codeline as HW
independent as possible. There are others activities, no only in the
HAL, towards this goal.

This is achieved by having a centralized platform specification that
the libcamera2 can query for HW specific information.

\section jpegbufflow JPEG encoder buffer flow

\subsection input  Encoder input buffer flow
The snapshot buffers are allocated currently by the Picture Thread
An allocation request is sent from ControlThread to the PictureThread in 
either of these two situations:
- after preview has started.
- when the snapshot resolution changes
After allocation the PictureThread initializes the HW encoder with the pre-allocated
buffers. At this stage the HW encoder creates surfaces from those buffers and also
creates the libVA encoding context

During the take_picture sequence the ControlThread retrieves the current snapshot
buffers from the PictureThread and passes those to the AtomISP class to start
the device for capture.

There is no need to return the buffers to the PictureThread when going back to
the preview state. The PictureThread will de-allocate the buffers when it is
destroyed.

\subsection output Encoder output buffer flow
The PictureThread instance allocates a couple of buffers used to store the
Thumbnail image (if there is one) and the EXIF data. The allocation of both buffers
is done before encode. They belong to the PictureThread and will be freed in the
destructor

When an encode request arrives to PicThread it allocates the buffer that will
contain the final EXIF data plus the main JPEG. This allocation is done once
the size of each element is known.
The contents of the HW encoding process are copied directly to this buffer from
the internal VACoded buffer. This memcopy is currently unavoidable.

The JPEG buffer is sent to the callback thread that will release the memory
once the user callback has completed

\subsection interencode Interleaved encoding
The encoding process of thumbnail(a.k.a. postview) and main image (a.k.a. snapshot)
is currently interleaved. The HW encoder is configured to start the main image
encoding first and then the thumbnail is encoded using the SW encoder.
Once the thumbnail is completed we wait for the HW encoder to finish and compose
the final buffer (EXIF+JPEG).

In this way the thumbnail encoding time is not affecting the overall JPEG encoding


\section contcapture Continuous Capture Design

\subsection ccoverview Overview

Continuous Capture is a feature of CSS v1.5 video firmware, which allows
to run multiple pipelines in parallel. This mechanism enables multiple
end-user features such as Zero-Shutter-Lag, Time Nudge and Continuous Viewfinder.

\subsection ccseq Sequence diagrams

User-space kernel interaction when continuous capture is started (application
start).
